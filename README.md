## Description 

* Here i made a Todo-application in Angular where the user can create a task and then also add a status to the task. The user can click on the task and leave comments on it. The user also navigate back to the homepage and the data will remain the same untill the user hit the refresh button. 

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.1.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
